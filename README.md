## overview

The Hub is a fault tolerant, highly available service for data storage and distribution.  All features are available via a REST API.

It supports channels of data ordered by time.
Channels represent uniquely addressable items that are iterable and query-able by time.  Each item may be up to to 40 MB.

You can read more about what the hub in the wiki   
* [What is the Hub?](https://github.com/flightstats/hub/wiki/What-is-the-Hub)
* [Goals](https://github.com/flightstats/hub/wiki/Goals)
* [and more](https://github.com/flightstats/hub/wiki)

## quick start

Install Docker and use the hub docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/flightstats/hub/

```
docker run -p 80:80 flightstats/hub:latest
```

## consistency

* All times from the Hub are in UTC.
* By default all iteration, queries, webhooks and websockets return items with stable ordering.  Data is considered stable when iteration will provide consistent results.
* All requests for a specific item by id will return that item if it exists.

## error handling

Clients should consider handling transient server errors (500 level return codes) with retry logic.  This helps to ensure that transient issues (networking, etc)
  do not prevent the client from entering data. For Java clients, this framework provides many options - https://github.com/rholder/guava-retrying
We also recommend clients use exponential backoff for retries.

## FAQ

* Why does /latest (or /earliest) return 404?

  Either data has never been added to that channel, or the last data added to that channel is older than the time to live (ttlDays).

* How can I guarantee ordering for items within a channel?

  You can wait for the response for an item before writing the next item.  

## hub resources

To explore the Resources available in the Hub, go to http://hub/

**Note**
For the purposes of this document, the Hub is at http://hub/.
On your local machine it is at: http://localhost/ (docker) or http://localhost:9080/ (native)

## list channels

To obtain the list of channels:

`GET http://hub/channel`

On success:  `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
Content-Type is `application/json`

```json
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/channel"
    },
    "channels" : [ {
      "name" : "stumptown",
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown"
    }, {
      "name" : "ptown",
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/ptown"
    } ]
  }
}
```
    
## create a channel

* `name` _is case sensitive_, is limited to _48 characters_, and may only contain `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, hyphen `-` and underscore `_`.
 Surrounding white space is trimmed (e.g. "  foo  " -> "foo" ).

* `owner` is optional and is limited to 48 characters.

* `ttlDays` and `maxItems` are optional, and only one can have a value greater than zero at a time. If neither is specified, a default value of 120 ttlDays is used.
Please see [channel limits](#channel-limits) for more details.  To change a channel to ttlDays or maxItems, set the other value explicitly to zero. 

* `description` is optional and defaults to an empty string.  This text field can be up to 1024 bytes long.

* `tags` is an optional array of string values.  Tag values are limited to 48 characters, and may only contain `a-z`, `A-Z` and `0-9`.
A channel may have at most 20 tags.

* `replicationSource` is the optional fully qualified path to channel in a another hub.  The data from the other channel
will be duplicated into this channel.  Please see [replication](#replication) for more details.

* `global` are optional settings for distributing data from a master hub cluster to other satellite hub clusters.
Please see [global channels](#global-channels) for more details.

* `storage` is the optional specification of how to store long term data.  The default is `SINGLE`.  
High volume channels can see significant reductions in S3 costs by using `BATCH`.  
`BOTH` is a way to transition between the two states, and perform comparisons.  More information in [storage](#storage)

* `protect` is the optional setting to prevent changes which might cause some data loss.
Please see [channel modification](#channel-modification) for more details.

`PUT http://hub/channel/stumptown`

* Content-type: application/json

```json
{
   "ttlDays": "14",
   "description": "a sequence of all the coffee orders from stumptown",
   "tags": ["coffee"]
}
```

On success:  `HTTP/1.1 201 OK`

```json
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown"
        },
        "latest": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/latest"
        },
        "earliest": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/earliest"
        },
        "bulk": {
             "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/bulk"
        },
        "ws": {
            "href": "ws://hub/channel/stumptown/ws"
        },
        "time": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time"
        },
        "status" : {
              "href" : "http://hub/channel/load_test_1/status"
        }
    },
    "name": "stumptown",
    "creationDate": "2013-04-23T20:25:33.434Z",
    "ttlDays": 14,
    "description": "a sequence of all the coffee orders from stumptown",
    "tags": ["coffee"],
    "replicationSource": ""
}
```

Here's how you can do this with curl:
```bash
curl -i -X PUT http://hub/channel/stumptown

or

curl -i -X PUT --header "Content-type: application/json"  --data '{ "description" : "stumpy", "ttlDays" : 1 }' http://localhost:9080/channel/stumptown
```

## update a channel

Some channel metadata can be updated. The update format looks much like the channel create format
(currently, only `ttlDays`, `description`, `tags`, `owner` and `replicationSource` can be updated).
Each of these fields is optional.

`PUT http://hub/channel/channelname`

## fetch channel metadata

To fetch metadata about a channel, do a GET on its `self` link:

`GET http://hub/channel/stumptown`

On success: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`  (see example return data from create channel).

Here's how you can do this with curl:

`curl http://hub/channel/stumptown`

## insert content into channel

To insert data to a channel, issue a POST on the channel's `self` URI and specify the appropriate
content-type header (all content types should be supported).  The `Content-Encoding` header is optional:

```
POST http://hub/channel/stumptown
Content-type: text/plain
Content-Encoding: gzip
Accept: application/json
___body_contains_arbitrary_content
```

On success: `HTTP/1.1 201 Created`

`Location: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}`

```json
{
  "_links" : {
    "channel" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown"
    },
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}"
    }
  },
  "timestamp" : "2013-04-23T20:42:31.146Z"
}
```

Here's how you could do this with curl:

```bash
curl -i -X POST --header "Content-type: text/plain" --data 'your content here' http://hub/channel/stumptown
```

## bulk insert content into channel

You can also insert items in bulk into the hub, and each item will receive a unique ordered uri.

Currently, [MIME](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) is the only way to insert bulk items.
Issue a POST on the channel's `bulk` URI and specify the appropriate "multipart" Content-Type.

Notes on MIME:
* All lines must be terminated by [CRLF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-2.1)
* Anything before the starting boundary is ignored 
* An empty line after the optional Content headers starts the message body
* binary payloads are not currently supported

```
POST http://hub/channel/stumptown/bulk
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=abcdefg
Accept: application/json

This is a message with multiple parts in MIME format.  This section is ignored.
--abcdefg
Content-Type: application/xml

<coffee><roast>french</roast><coffee>
--abcdefg
Content-Type: application/json
 
{ "type" : "coffee", "roast" : "french" } 
--abcdefg--
```

On success: `HTTP/1.1 201 Created`

```json
{
  "_links" : {
    "channel" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown"
    },
    "uris" : [
      "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}000",
      "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}001"
    ]
  }
}
```

## fetch content from channel

To fetch content that was stored into a hub channel, do a `GET` on the `self` link in the above response:

`GET http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}`

On success: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
```
Content-Type: text/plain
Creation-Date: 2013-04-23T00:21:30.662Z
Link: <http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}/previous>;rel="previous"
Link: <http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}/next>;rel="next"
...other.headers...

your content here
```

Note: The `Content-Type` will match the Content-Type used when inserting the data.  
There are two `Link` headers that provide links to the previous and next items in the channel.
The `Creation-Date` header will correspond to when the data was inserted into the channel.

Here's how you can do this with curl:

`curl -i http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}`

## fetch latest channel item

To retrieve the latest item inserted into a channel, issue a HEAD or GET request on the `latest` link 
returned from the channel metadata.  The Hub will issue a 303 redirect.

`HEAD http://hub/channel/stumptown/latest`

On success:  `HTTP/1.1 303 See Other`
`Location: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}`

Here is how you can do this with curl:

`curl -I http://hub/channel/stumptown/latest`

You can also retrieve the latest N items by using /latest/{n}

## fetch earliest channel item

To retrieve the earliest item inserted into a channel, issue a HEAD or GET request on the `earliest` link 
returned from the channel metadata.  The Hub will issue a 303 redirect.

`HEAD http://hub/channel/stumptown/earliest`

On success:  `HTTP/1.1 303 See Other`
`Location: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2013/04/23/20/42/31/749/{hash}`

Here is how you can do this with curl:

`curl -I http://hub/channel/stumptown/earliest`

You can also retrieve the earliest N items by using /earliest/{n}

## next and previous links

A GET on the next and previous links returned as headers with content will redirect to those respective items.  A 404 will be returned if they don't exist.

Any item's uri can be appended with /next or /previous to navigate forward or backward.
If you append a number /next/20 or /previous/15, and you'll receive a list of that many items.

For example:

`GET http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/50/514/xIXX5L/previous/3`

On success: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
```
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/50/514/xIXX5L/previous/3"
    },
    "next" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/49/887/x46z8p/next/3"
    },
    "previous" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/42/751/mRklXw/previous/3"
    },
    "uris" : [
        "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/47/376/swdWJD", 
        "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/48/115/lDCHYY", 
        "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/49/887/x46z8p" 
        ]
  }
}
```

## fetch bulk content from channel

Any query operation (including next, previous, earliest, latest, and times) supports the addition of the
query parameter `?bulk=true`.  Using the bulk parameter will result in the content of the query items being streamed
as [MIME](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) or as a zip file to the client.
To get a zip file, specify the 'Accept' header as `application/zip`.

*NOTE* `bulk` was previously named `batch`.  `batch` is deprecated. 

The hub will generate a random 70 character boundary, and follows the same MIME rules as [bulk insert content into channel](#bulk-insert-content-into-channel)

Using the previous example:
          
`GET http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/50/514/xIXX5L/previous/3?bulk=true`

On success: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

header:
```
content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||
```

body:
```
--||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Key: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/47/376/swdWJD

{ "type" : "coffee", "roast" : "french" } 
--||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Key: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/48/115/lDCHYY

{ "type" : "coffee", "roast" : "italian" }
--||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Key: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/23/14/49/887/x46z8p
 
{ "type" : "coffee", "roast" : "hair bender" } 
--||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||~~~~~~||||||--
```

## channel status

A GET on the status link for a channel will return the link to the latest item in the channel.
If a replicationSource is defined, it will also return the link the the latest in the replication hub.

`GET http://hub/channel/stumptown/status`

On success: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
```
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/status"
        },
        "latest": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/01/23/17/33/08/895/1524"
        },
        "replicationSourceLatest": {
            "href": "http://hub-other/channel/stumptown/1526"
        }
    }
}
```

## channel limits

`ttlDays` and `maxItems` are mutually exclusive.  When one field is set, the other must be 0 (zero).

`ttlDays` is used to limit the number of items in a channel by time.
The hub strictly enforces the time limit for range queries, and is less strict for indivdual items.

For example, if a channel has ttlDays = 3, and you query `/earliest/10', the results returned will be limited to 3 days ago from now.
Each item returned will be available for 15 minutes after the ttl has expired.

`maxItems` has a limit of 5000 items.  It is intended to be useful for channels that are updated infrequently.
Once a channel has reached its maxItems, older items will be removed.  maxItems should be considered eventually consistent.
 
For eaxmple, if you quickly insert 1,000 items into a channel with maxItems = 50, a query of `/latest/100` will return 100 items.
 Within 12 hours, the limit of 50 will be enforced.

If you change a channel from ttlDays to maxItems, it will also take up to 12 hours for the limit to be enforced.

## tag interface

Tags are used to logically group channels.  To retrieve all of the tags in the Hub:

`GET http://hub/tag`

On success: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
```json
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/tag"
    },
    "tags" : [ {
      "name" : "orders",
      "href" : "http://hub/tag/orders"
    }, {
      "name" : "coffee",
      "href" : "http://hub/tag/coffee"
    } ]
  }
}
```

Any of the returned tag links can be followed to see all of the channels with that tag:

`GET http://hub/tag/coffee`

On success: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
```json
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/tag/coffee"
    },
    "latest": {
        "href": "http://hub/tag/coffee/latest"
    },
    "earliest": {
        "href": "http://hub/tag/coffee/earliest"
    },
    "time": {
        "href": "http://hub/tag/coffee/time"
    },
    "channels" : [ {
      "name" : "stumptown",
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown"
    }, {
      "name" : "spella",
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/spella"
    } ]
  }
}
```

## tag unions

Tags can also be used for a read-only union set of all it's channels.
[next and previous links](#next-and-previous-links), [latest](#latest-channel-item), 
[earliest](#earliest-channel-item) and [time](#time-interface) work the same as their channel analogs.
Tag operations can be accessed through /tag/{tag-name} or /channel/{channel-name}/

Example operations:
```
GET http://hub/tag/coffee/latest
GET http://hub/tag/coffee/earliest
GET http://hub/tag/coffee/2015/06/25/16
GET http://hub/tag/coffee/2015/06/24/19/48/17/000/abc/previous
GET http://hub/tag/coffee/2015/06/24/19/48/17/000/abc/next/10
GET http://hub/channel/spella/2015/06/24/19/48/17/000/abc/next/10?tag=coffee
```
Operations through the channel interface (/channel/{channel-name}/) can a tag parameter.  Using the tag parameter allows the user to stay in the tag context.

For example:

`GET http://hub/tag/coffee/latest`

returns a redirect to

`http://hub/channel/spella/2015/06/24/19/48/17/000/abc?tag=coffee`

Following the previous on that item and including the tag

`http://hub/channel/spella/2015/06/24/19/48/17/000/abc/previous?tag=coffee`

returns a redirect to an item on a different channel

`http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/06/24/19/40/17/000/qwe?tag=coffee`

## time interface

The time interface provides a variety of options to query data in a hub channel.  All queries will only show items
 with stable ordering by default.  If you want to see items which might be unstable, add the parameter ```?stable=false```

To see time format options, issue a GET request on the `time` link returned from the channel metadata.

`GET http://hub/channel/stumptown/time`

```json
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time"
        },
        "second": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/05/58/55",
            "template": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}/{minute}/{second}{?stable}",
            "redirect": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/second"
        },
        "minute": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/05/58",
            "template": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}/{minute}{?stable}",
            "redirect": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/minute"
        },
        "hour": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23/05",
            "template": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}{?stable}",
            "redirect": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/hour"
        },
        "day": {
            "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/12/23",
            "template": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/{year}/{month}/{day}{?stable}",
            "redirect": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/day"
        }
    },
    "now": {
        "iso8601": "2014-12-23T05:59:00.162Z",
        "millis": 1419314340162
    },
    "stable": {
        "iso8601": "2014-12-23T05:58:55.000Z",
        "millis": 1419314335000
    }
}
```

Call a named uri, and the Hub will issue a 303 redirect for the current time with the specified resolution.

`HEAD http://localhost:9080/channel/stumptown/time/second`

On success:  `HTTP/1.1 303 See Other`
`Location: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31

A GET on the returned Location will return all of the content URIs within that period.

`GET http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31`

On success:  `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
Content-Type is `application/json`

```json
{
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31"
    },
    "uris" : [ 
        "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/149/{hash1}", 
        "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/359/{hash2}",
        "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/642/{hash3}" 
    ]
  }
}
```

If no items were submitted during that time, 'uris' is an empty array.
If the time requested is the current minute, 'uri's will reflect all of the items inserted within the minute so far, and will
increase as other items are inserted.

### time resolution

You can request all of the items by the time resolution you specify in the URL.  
For all the items in a minute: `GET http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42`
For all the items in an hour: `GET http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10`

You can also access the urls via convenience methods:

`HEAD http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/minute`
`HEAD http://hub/channel/stumptown/time/hour`

The output format is the same regardless of time resolution

## notifications

The Hub supports multiple ways of receiving notifications for new items in a channel.
 
A [websocket](#websocket) returns the id of each new item.  A websocket is connected to a single server, and loses state on disconnect.

[events](#events) use http to return the id and payload of new items.  Events are connected to a single server, and *will* support reconecting on disconnect.

[webhook](#webhook) returns single or batch ids to an application's http endpoint.   Provides more flexibility than events or websockets.

## websocket

Clients may "subscribe" to single channel's items by listening on a websocket.  
In the channel metadata there is a `ws` link, and a websocket aware client may connect to this URL.

Clients should be aware that websockets are a "best effort" service, and are not stateful.  If the ws connection is lost,
which will happen on hub server restarts, the client will need to reconnect, and may have missed items.

Once connected, the line-oriented protocol is simple:

Each time data is inserted into the channel, the hub will send a line to the client with the
URL for that content.

```
http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/149/{hash1}
http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/359/{hash2}
http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/642/{hash3}
...etc...
```

The returned items are stable only.

## events

Clients connecting to an event endpoint will receive the id, content type and payload of each new item in the channel.
The [Server Sent Events](#https://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) standard defines the http interface and format. 
The format is designed for UTF-8 payloads.

Calling `curl http://hub/channel/stumptown/events` will return every new item in chronological order.
Some browsers support events natively also.
 
```

event: application/json
id: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/149/QWERTY
data: {"order": 474689, "item": "latte"}

event: application/json
id: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/201/ASDFGH
data: {"order": 474690, "item": "americano"}

event: application/json
id: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/251/ZXCVBN
data: {"order": 474691, "item": "drip"}

...etc...
```

Events can also be started from an item `http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/149/QWERTY/events`

Events also supports the `Last-Event-ID` header.  Some clients will automatically attempt to reconnect, and when they reconnect,
the client will include the last `id` received as the `Last-Event-ID` header.  The header can be used on either endpoint.

The following examples will both start at the same point in the channel:

```
curl -i --header "Last-Event-ID: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/201/ASDFGH" http://localhost:8080/channel/streamTest/events

curl -i --header "Last-Event-ID: http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/201/ASDFGH" http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/149/QWERTY/events

```


## webhook

A Webhook is registered for a client's http endpoint and that endpoint recieves Http POSTs of json uris, and the Hub server keeps track of the Webhook's state.

* `name` is used in the url for the callback.  Names are limited to 48 characters and may only contain `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, hyphen `-` and underscore `_`.

* `callbackUrl` is the fully qualified location to receive callbacks from the server.

* `channelUrl` is the fully qualified channel location to monitor for new items.

* `parallelCalls` is the optional number of callbacks to make in parallel.  The default value is `1`.
If parallelCalls is higher than one, callback ordering is not guaranteed.
parallelCalls can be modified with a call to PUT 

* `startItem` is the optional location where the callback should start from.
  If startItem is a fully qualified item, that next item after it will be sent via the callback.
  If startItem is 'previous', the previous stable item on the channel will be sent as the first callback item.
  startItem is *only* used when creating a webhook.  If you want to change the pointer of a callback, you will need to
delete the callback first.

* `paused` is optional and defaults to false.   When true, this will pause a webhook.

* `batch` is optional and defaults to `SINGLE`, which will return each item by itself.
  Setting the value to `SECOND` will return each second's worth of data in the channel.
  Setting the value to `MINUTE` will return each minute's worth of data in the channel.
  SECOND and MINUTE callbacks will return an empty array of uris if there are no items.

* `heartbeat` is optional and defaults to false for `SINGLE`. `MINUTE` batches always have a heartbeat.
   A heartbeat is a callback which identifies the end of a minute period.  It may have an empty `uris` array.
   It will include an `id` field which identifies the ending minute.
   
* `maxWaitMinutes` is optional and defaults to 1.  maxWaitMinutes is the maximum amount of time between retry attempts to the callbackUrl.

* `ttlMinutes` is optional and defaults to 0.  If ttlMinutes is greater than 0, the hub will not attempt to send an item which is older than the ttl.

To get a list of existing webhooks:

`GET http://hub/webhook`
 
To create a new webhook:

`PUT http://hub/webhook/{name}`

``` json
{
  "callbackUrl" : "http://client/path/callback",
  "channelUrl" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown",
  "parallelCalls" : 2,
  "startItem" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/02/06/22/28/43/239/s03ub2",
  "paused" : false,
  "batch" : "SINGLE",
  "heartbeat" : false,
  "maxWaitMinutes" : 1,
  "ttlMinutes" : 0
}
```

Once a Webhook is created, the channel's name can not change.  PUT may be safely called multiple times with the same
 configuration.  Changes to `startItem` and `batch` will be ignored.

To see the configuration and status of a webhook:

`GET http://hub/webhook/{name}`

To delete a webhook:

`DELETE http://hub/webhook/{name}`

DELETE will return a 202, and it may take up to a minute to properly stop a webhook from servicing the callback.

#### webhook behavior

The application listening at `callbackUrl` will get a payload POSTed to it for every new item in the channel, starting after `startItem` or at the time the webhook is created.
A 2XX-level client response is considered successful.  Any other response is considered an error, and will cause the server to retry.   Redirects are allowed.
Retries will use an exponential backoff up to one minute, and the server will continue to retry at one minute intervals indefinitely.

An example SINGLE payload:

``` json
{
  "name" : "stumptownCallback",
  "type" : "item",
  "uris" : [ "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/759/s03ub2" ]
}
```

An example SINGLE heartbeat:

``` json
{
  "name" : "stumptownCallback",
  "type" : "heartbeat",
  "id" : "2014/01/13/10/42",
  "uris" : []
}
```

An example MINUTE payload:

``` json
{
  "name" : "stumptownCallbackBatch",
  "type" : "items",
  "id" : "2014/01/13/10/42",
  "url" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42",
  "batchUrl" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42?batch=true",
  "uris" : [ 
    "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/05/436/abcdef",
    "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/31/759/s03ub2"
    "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42/39/029/zxcvbn"
  ]
}
```

An example MINUTE heartbeat :

``` json
{
  "name" : "stumptownCallbackBatch",
  "type" : "heartbeat",
  "id" : "2014/01/13/10/42",
  "url" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42",
  "batchUrl" : "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2014/01/13/10/42?batch=true",
  "uris" : [ ]
}
```

## provider interface

For external data providers, there is a simplified interface suitable for exposing to the authenticated outside world.

`POST http://hub/provider/`

* it creates a channel if it doesn't exist
* it expects a `channelName` header
* does not support any other HTTP methods
* does not return any links
* access by external data providers is controlled through a proxy maintained by Operations

## delete a channel


To delete a channel when after you no longer need it, simply issue a `DELETE` command to that channel.
Delete returns a 202, indicating that the request has been accepted, and will take an indeterminate time to process.
If you re-create a channel before all the data has been deleted, the behavior is undefined.

 `DELETE http://hub/channel/stumptown`

Here's how you can do this with curl:
```bash
curl -i -X DELETE http://hub/channel/stumptown
```

## replication

The hub can replicate a source channel from another hub instance into a destination channel.  The destination channel can have any name.

To configure replication, specify `replicationSource` when creating the new channel in the desired destination.

To stop replication, either delete the destination channel, or PUT the destination channel with a blank `replicationSource`.

Modifications to configuration takes effect immediately.

Replication destination channels do not allow inserts.

## global channels

A Global channel is defined as a channel with the `global` object set.

```
    global : {
        master : "http://hub.europe",
        satellites : [ "http://hub.america", "http://hub.asia" ]
    }

```

* `master` should be set to the load balanced url of the hub cluster which should receive writes.
* `satellites` should be set to the load balanced url(s) of the hub cluster(s) which should receive data from the master.
* The channel configuration will be the same on all configured hub clusters.
* A global channel will automatically receive a tag of "global".

## historical channels

A historical channel is defined as a channel with the `historical` flag set to true (defaults to ```false```).

`historical: true`

This type of channel operates like a normal channel with data being added going forward in time. The exception being
you can control the exact time of each payload.

To insert data into a historical channel you specify the instant as part of the URI.

`POST http://hub/channel/stumptown/2016/5/14/12/00/00/000`

In order for the temporal features of the Hub to work (e.g. [webhooks](#webhook), [replication](#replication)) you must provide an additional
header when finalizing data for a given minute.

`minuteComplete: true` (defaults to `false`)

### Comparison with Replication

* Global channels should be at the same environment level - dev, staging, prod
* Replication recreates all the data in a different S3 bucket, Global does not
* Global can use multiple Hub clusters to answer questions, Replication does not
* Global can support failover, and the use of a global hub domain

For more details about [global channels](https://github.com/flightstats/hub/wiki/Global-Hub)

## alerts

The hub can send alerts based on the number of items in a channel, or how long a webhook is lagging a channel.

For channels, an alert is created if inserts in `source` `operator` `threshold` within `timeWindowMinutes`
eg: if inserts in stumptown <  100 within 20 minutes

For webhooks, an alert is created if the callback `source` lags behind it's channel by `timeWindowMinutes`
eg: if the last completed callback to stumptownCallback is 10 minutes behind the last insert into it's channel

* `name` _is case sensitive_, is limited to _48 characters_, and may only contain `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and underscore `_`.

* `source` is the name of the channel or webhook to monitor

* `serviceName` is a user defined end point for the alert, which could be an email address, service name, etc

* `type` can be `channel` or `webhook`

* `timeWindowMinutes` the period of time to evaluate

* `operator` (channel only) can be `>=`, `>`, `==`, `<`, or `<=`

* `threshold` (channel only) is the value to compare

### create or change and alert

Alerts can be created and changed with PUT 

`PUT http://hub/alert/stumptownAlert`

* Content-type: application/json

```json
{
    "source": "stumptown",
    "serviceName": "stumptown@example.com",
    "timeWindowMinutes": 5,
    "type": "channel",
    "operator": "==",
    "threshold": 0
}
```

On success:  `HTTP/1.1 201 OK`

```json
{
    "name": "stumptownAlert",
    "source": "stumptown",
    "serviceName": "stumptown@example.com",
    "timeWindowMinutes": 5,
    "type": "channel",
    "operator": "==",
    "threshold": 0,
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://hub/alert/stumptownAlert"
        },
        "status": {
            "href": "http://hub/alert/stumptownAlert/status"
        }
    }
}
```

### channel alert status

Following the status link from _links.status.href shows the channel history for the current state of the alert

`GET http://hub/alert/stumptownAlert/status`

```json
{
    "name": "stumptownAlert",
    "period": "minute",
    "alert": true,
    "type": "channel",
    "history": [
    {
        "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/06/17/19/21?stable=true",
        "items": 0
    },
    {
        "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/06/17/19/22?stable=true",
        "items": 0
    },
    {
        "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/06/17/19/23?stable=true",
        "items": 0
    },
    {
        "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/06/17/19/24?stable=true",
        "items": 0
    },
    {
        "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/06/17/19/25?stable=true",
        "items": 0
    }
    ],
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://hub/alert/stumptownAlert/status"
        }
    }
}
```

### webhook alert status

Following the status link from _links.status.href shows the latest item in a channel, and the last completed callback for that webhook.

`GET http://hub/alert/stumptownWebhook/status`

```
{
    "name": "stumptownWebhook",
    "alert": false,
    "type": "webhook",
    "history": [
        {
        "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/06/17/18/34/38/306/UqCNR4",
        "name": "channelLatest"
        },
        {
        "href": "http://hub/channel/stumptown/2015/06/17/18/34/38/306/UqCNR4",
        "name": "lastCompletedCallback"
        }
    ],
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://hub/alert/stumptownWebhook/status"
        }
    }
}
```
## health check

The Health Check returns a 200 status code when the server can connect to each data store.
If the server can not access a data store, it will return a 500 status code.

Responding to http connections is the last step on startup, so the health check will be unresponsive until startup is complete.
On shutdown, the server immediately stops responding to new http connections, so there are no separate codes for startup and shutdown.

`GET http://hub/health`

```json
{
  "healthy" : true,
  "description" : "OK",
  "version" : "2014-03-26.126"
}
```

## storage

The Hub has two options to store data:
* It can use a combination of a local cache and [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* It can use a single drive shared across the cluster
 
For Hubs which use S3, the channel option `storage` can make a significant difference in costs.
High volume channels should prefer `BATCH` to reduce costs.


## access control

If admins set hub property `hub.protect.channels` to `true`, normal users of the system will not be able to change a 
channel in a way that could cause data loss.   
If `hub.protect.channels` is `false`, end users can optionally set `protect` on specific channels.

If `protect` is true:
* `storage` can only be changed to `BOTH`
* `tags` can not be removed
* `maxItems` and `ttlDays` can not decrease
* `replicationSource` can not change
* `global` can only have satellites added
* `protect` can not be reset from `true`
* channel can not be deleted

Instead, a user will need to make the command(s) while logged into a hub server.
 
```
curl -i -X PUT --header "Content-type: application/json"  --data '{"ttlDays" : 1}' http://localhost:8080/channel/stumptown
```

## encrypted-hub

The Encrypted Hub (EH) is a separate installation of The Hub.
EH also has some additional features to the normal Hub:

* All channel items are encrypted at rest (this relies on disk level encryption)
* All channel items are encrypted in flight
* All access to channel items (reads and writes) require authentication and are access controlled

Channel inserts can be audited by a GET or HEAD to each channel item.  The creator of the record is returned in a `User` header.

## internal api

The hub uses a number of endpoints not intended for use by clients.
All of these are under http://hub/internal
Some of these are useful for debugging, such as :
* Read only view into zookeeper values - http://hub/internal/zookeeper
* Traces of calls into the hub, including active, slowest and recent - http://hub/internal/traces
